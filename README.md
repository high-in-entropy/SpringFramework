## Spring Framework

I tried my hands on Spring Framework. Right from basics which includes XML based IOC, Annotation based IOC and Java Class based IOC, to Spring JDBC Template and Spring MVC. Spring MVC includes a simple registration page, which persists data into a MySQL Database using JDBCTemplate and a login page which authenticates user and logs them in. Future pushes will include use of Spring Boot and Spring Security. This also happens to be my first major hands-on Java :")
